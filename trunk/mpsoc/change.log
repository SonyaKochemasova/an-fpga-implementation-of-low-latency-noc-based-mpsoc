All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

##[1.8.0] - 16-5-2018
## Added
-  Support hard-built QoS/EoS support in NoC using weighted Round-Robin arbiter
-  Add real application task grah simulation support in NoC simulator 
-  add new 
-  Add two new (OpenRISC) softprocessors: Or1200 & Mor1kx 
-  Add documention for timer, ni-master, ni-slave, memory, and dma IP cores.
-  Add User manual file
-  Add USB blaster II suooprt in JTAG controller
-  Add GUI for adding new Altera FPGA boards. 
-  The simulator/ emulator now can provide additional smulation results 
	(a) Average latency per average desired flit injection ratio
	(b) Average throughput per average desired flit injection ratio
	(c) send/received packets number for each router at different injection ratios
	(d) send/received worst-case delay for each router at different injection ratios
	(e) Simulation execution clock cycles
## changed
-  Fixe the bug in NoC that halts the simulation when B is defined as 2.
-  Support Burst Type Extension for Incrementing and Decrementing bursts in RAM controller 



##[1.7.0] - 15-7-2017
## Added
-  Software compilation text-editor
-  Processing tile Diagrame Viewer 
-  Modelsim/Verilator/QuartusII GUI compilation assist
-  Multi-channel DMA
## changed
-  New multi-channel DMA-based NI



##[1.6.0] - 6-3-2017
## Added
-  NoC GUI simulator (using Verilator) 


##[1.5.2] - 22-2-2017
## changed
- fixed bug in wishbone bus 

##[1.5.1] - 3-2-2017
## changed
- src_c/jtag_main.c:  variable length memory support is added.
- NoC emulator:  Jtag tabs are reduced to total of 3. A 64 core 2-VC NoC emulation is sucessfully tested on DE4 FPGA board.
- ssa: Now can work with fully adaptive routing.


##[1.5.0] - 13-10-2016
### Added
- static straight allocator (SSA) which accelerates packets traversing to the same direction to the NoC router.
- NoC emulator.
- Altor processor.
- Jtag_wb: allow access to the wishbone bus slave ports via Jtag. 
- Jtag_main: A C code which allows host PC to have access to the jtag_wb.  


## changed
- Memory IP cores are categorized into two IPs: Single and double port. 
- The access via jtag_wb or Altera In-System Memory Content Editor is added as optional via parameter setting for single port memory.



##[1.0.0] - 27-1-2016
### added
- ProNoC: new version with GUI generator
- Interface generator
- IP generator
- Processing tile generator
- NoC based MCSoC generator
